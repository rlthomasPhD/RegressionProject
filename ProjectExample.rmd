Executive Summary
The purpose of this report was to analyze the impact of several independent variables on the dependent variable of miles per gallon (mpg). Data was extracted from the “mtcars” data set from the Motor Trend magazine. Exploratory analyses and regression models were utilized and it was found that transmission type influenced mpg such that manual performed better than automatic. With further model selection it was found that qsec, weight, and weight by transmission type were statistically significant in the multivariate model. That is, when weight and qsec are held constant manual transmission performed than automatic on miles per gallon.

Exploratory Analysis
To better understand the data an exploratory analysis was conducted. Please find cursory results in this section and detailed results in the Appendix.

Regression Models
Is an automatic or manual transmission better for miles/(US) gallon (MPG) ? 
It was found that Transmission Type had an impact on MPG such that Manual (M = 24.39) performed better than Automatic (M = 17.15) p <.005.

Model Selection
By examining the full model, there was an R Square of 0.779, however, no variables were significant at the .05 level and the Residual standard error was 2.83.

> fullModel <- lm(mpg ~ ., data=mtcars)
lm(formula = mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)
Residual standard error: 2.833 on 15 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.8931,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.779 
F-statistic:  7.83 on 16 and 15 DF,  p-value: 0.000124

By eliminating variables that did not meet the 95% confidence level criteria a model was created with 3 statistically significant variables, R Square = .85, and Residual standard error = 2.46. A better fit than the previous model.

Next, exploratory graphs (Appendix) indicated a potential interaction effect and it was found there was a statistically significant impact of the interaction term of Weight by Transmission Type. This was a better model fit than the previous two model with R Square = .88, and Residual standard error = 2.08.

Lastly, by conducted the nested (hierarchical regression analysis) the model with the best fit is the interaction term modeling:

> amIntWtModel<-lm(mpg ~ wt + qsec + am + wt:am, data=mtcars)

Residual Analysis

Please see Appendix for Residual Plots. In sum, the residual vs. fitted plots seem random; the Q-Q plot of residuals follows the line and shows no large outliers, the residual vs. leverage plot demonstrate no large outliers, and dfbetas (Appendix) indicate basic assumption have been met.
